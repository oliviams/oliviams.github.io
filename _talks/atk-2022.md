As part of the [Approaches to Knowledge](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/approaches-to-knowledge-introduction-to-interdisciplinarity-BASC0001) lecture series, I gave a talk describing my research. In particular, I highlighted the interdisciplinary aspeects of my current reseach, and emphasised the contributions from each discipline.
