I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UCL, focusing on the emergence of cooperation within groups of agents - I am particularly interested in irrational behaviour. 

My PhD is funded by the Leverhulme Trust as part of the [Leverhulme Doctoral Training Programme for the Ecological Study of the Brain](http://ecologicalbrain.org/).

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in understanding the emergence of cooperation within multi-agent systems, with particular focus on signalling and irrational behaviour. My approach to this problem come both from a theoretical perspective, as well as investigating the application of this research to international relations and conflict studies.
