I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UCL, focusing on rational and irrational behaviour in multi-agent systems. I am interested in the emergence of cooperation in scenarios of mixed or conflicting interests.

My PhD is funded by the Leverhulme Trust as part of the [Leverhulme Doctoral Training Programme for the Ecological Study of the Brain](http://ecologicalbrain.org/) and is supervised by Prof. Mirco Musolesi. I graduated from UCL with a degree in Arts and Sciences (BASc) in 2020, where I majored in mathematics and minored in conflict studies and international relations, alongside studying Arabic.

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in understanding the emergence of cooperation within multi-agent systems, with particular focus on rational and irrational behaviour. I have approached this problem from a theoretical perspective using reinforcement learning, as well as investigating the application of this research to international relations and conflict studies. I am also looking at how methods from other applications, primarily adversarial scenarios, may be adapted for interactions with potentially irrational agents.
